# Git branches and releases

English · [한국어](releases.ko.md)

Source lives on `main`. The `release` branch contains installable plugin files and the catalog. The catalog in the source branch stays an empty template. GitHub Actions builds a candidate first; pushing it is a separate, explicit choice.

Source is public at [tienne/orca-plugins](https://github.com/tienne/orca-plugins). Promotion uses a GitHub-hosted macOS runner; protected environments still need configuration for automated publication. Orca supports a publishing ref and directory; this branch split is our repository convention, not an Orca requirement.

## Branches and versioning

| Ref                  | Contents                                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`               | Source, documentation, tests, and workflows                       |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`    | Changes reviewed before merging into `main`                       |
| `release`            | Built plugins, `orca-catalog.json`, and `release-provenance.json` |
| `directory/git-logs` | Git Logs bundle at the repository root for directory discovery    |
| `git-logs/vX.Y.Z`    | Immutable tag on the source commit used for that version          |
| `vX.Y.Z`             | Tag on the root bundle commit used by the public directory        |

Do not edit generated files on `release`. Fix the source and publish a newer version. The first release candidate starts an orphan history; later candidates retain that history and other plugin directories. There is no merge from `release` back into `main`.

Only stable `X.Y.Z` versions are supported. Update `plugins/git-logs/orca-plugin.json` and the plugin's `package.json` before merging. A published version cannot be reused or downgraded. The catalog retains previous releases; after 32 releases the script stops so compatibility can be reviewed before pruning.

## CI

`ci.yml` calls `checks.yml` for pull requests to `main`, pushes to `main`, and manual checks. All checks run on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu with read-only repository access:

- actionlint checks workflow syntax and expressions. Its version and download checksum are pinned.
- pnpm installs the lockfile dependencies with Node 24.
- Nx runs build, typecheck, Git/translation/artifact tests, release tests, and browser UI tests.
- Playwright uses Chromium and starts a fresh preview server in CI.
- Successful runs save the installable plugin for 14 days. Browser results are retained for 7 days, including on failure.

Ubuntu CI release tests use a mock Orca adapter for orchestration checks. They do not establish Orca schema or hash compatibility. The promotion job repeats the tests with the installed Orca CLI.

## Configure GitHub once

These steps require the repository owner's action after publishing the source repository.

1. Use the intended repository, `tienne/orca-plugins`, and merge the reviewed source into `main`.
2. Protect `main` and require the CI check from the first workflow run. Restrict updates to `release` to release maintainers or the workflow. Allow the release actor to push directly; source-branch PR and CI requirements must not block generated release commits.
3. Use the committed `macos-15` (Apple Silicon) hosted runner configuration. No personal Mac, self-hosted registration or runner token is needed. The workflow sets up Node 24 and pnpm and installs the pinned Orca CLI into its temporary directory.
4. Create `release-preview` and `production` environments. Choose selected deployment branches and add exactly one branch rule, `main` (no tag or wildcard rules), for both environments. Configure required reviewers for `production` before enabling publication. The workflow references environments but **does not create their protection rules**.
5. Permit the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` to write repository contents for the publish job. Preview receives contents read access only; setup checks also require Actions read access. No personal access token is required for this same-repository layout.
6. Set the repository Actions variable `ORCA_RELEASE_ENABLED=true` after the environment protections and workflow changes are reviewed.

Promotion runs only for manually dispatched `main` workflows in `tienne/orca-plugins` with the enable variable set. Pull requests run the Ubuntu checks, not promotion. GitHub provides a fresh macOS VM for each promotion job; a developer's Mac can be turned off. Standard hosted runners are free for public repositories such as this one under the [current GitHub policy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/runners/github-hosted-runners). Recheck billing before changing repository visibility or choosing a larger runner.

`scripts/release/setup-orca-macos.sh` downloads the official [Orca 1.4.252 Apple Silicon archive](https://github.com/stablyai/orca/releases/tag/v1.4.252), checks its pinned SHA-256 before extraction, and verifies the CLI version. It sets `ORCA_CLI_COMMAND` for subsequent steps and does not launch the app or install it in `/Applications`. Only the standalone `plugin validate` and `plugin release-entry` commands are needed; neither loads or approves plugin code. When updating Orca, review the version and checksum together and rerun real CLI integration tests. A local download/setup check is not proof that a GitHub-hosted job passed; the first hosted preview still needs to run after these changes reach `main`.

Both actionlint and Orca downloads retry connection errors within a bounded retry window. If the release download URL remains unavailable, `gh api` downloads the same pinned asset ID through GitHub's official API using the job token. The same SHA-256 check must pass before extraction on either path. Local setup needs an authenticated `gh` session or `GH_TOKEN` for this fallback. When updating a tool, review its version, asset ID and checksum together.

### Read-only setup audit

After configuration, run:

```sh
pnpm nx run landmark-island:release-preflight --mode=publish
```

Use `git-logs:release-preflight` for Git Logs. This command only reads GitHub configuration with your existing `gh` authentication. It never changes settings, dispatches workflows, pushes refs or loads plugins. It checks activation, environment rules and production reviewers. No self-hosted runner lookup is needed. The underlying script returns exit 2 for missing or unverified setup and exit 1 for an input or execution error; Nx reports either as a failed task. Optional `--report=/tmp/new-release-readiness.json` saves a new report without overwriting an existing one.

Local inspection needs repository Variables read and Actions read access. The workflow uses its built-in token with Actions read and reads the activation variable through the Actions context. A successful setup audit does not prove hosted runner availability: the promotion job still must start and pass its real Orca checks. An HTTP 403 is reported as unknown, not as successful verification.

Configure [environments](https://github.com/tienne/orca-plugins/settings/environments) and [Actions variables](https://github.com/tienne/orca-plugins/settings/variables/actions) through the repository owner. These changes are not performed by preflight. GitHub documents [environment protection](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments) and [branch policy API access](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/deployments/branch-policies).

## Preview a release

In GitHub Actions, run **Release Orca Plugin** from `main`:

- `plugin`: `landmark-island` for Orcatopia, or `git-logs`.
- `expected_hash`: leave empty for preview.
- `version`: the stable version already committed to the manifest, such as `0.1.0`.
- `publish`: leave unchecked, which is the default.

A hosted preflight checks the committed version, activation variable and environment branch rules before CI or the macOS job. Missing settings or insufficient read access stops the run. The workflow then reruns CI, downloads the artifact from that same run and source SHA, and uses the macOS runner to prepare a candidate. It checks that the artifact matches the source manifest and runs Orca validation.

The candidate contains two commits:

1. Built files in `plugins/git-logs/` and source provenance.
2. The catalog entry generated by Orca, pointing to the **first commit** and its `contentHash`.

The job summary records the source, artifact, catalog commits, and content hash. The `release-plan-<SHA>` artifact includes the plan, candidate catalog, and provenance. Preview does not push any refs.

## Publish

Review the preview, then run **Release Orca Plugin** again from `main` with the same plugin and version, `publish` checked, and the preview’s complete content hash in `expected_hash`. This is a new run: it rebuilds and revalidates, rather than reusing the previous candidate's temporary directory. Review its source SHA. The publish command compares the new candidate’s content hash against your input and stops on a mismatch. Run and review another preview after any package change; do not substitute the new hash merely to bypass a failure. Environment rules are checked again immediately before publishing. The `production` environment applies the reviewer rules configured above.

The script checks the source checkout, candidate history, artifact bytes, Orca hash, catalog, provenance, destination URL, existing version tag, and current remote refs. It also compares committed blobs with the validated files, including catalog and provenance, to catch Git clean-filter changes. It then pushes the `release` branch and the source tag in one atomic Git operation.

The artifact commit must extend the previous release tip, and the catalog commit must immediately follow it. An exact-base server lease rejects release changes or deletion between preflight and push. The script does not allow history rewrites; the lease is used only after proving that parent relationship. Tags are never overwritten. Named-remote push URLs are ignored by pushing the verified repository URL explicitly; push-only URL rewrite rules are rejected.

The source SHA is fixed when the workflow starts. If `main` has already changed at publication preflight, the run stops. An independent `main` advance after that check does not change the artifact, tag, or provenance: the release still uses the reviewed source snapshot. The workflow does not lock or update `main`.

A failed push must not be force-retried. Fetch the new release state and prepare another candidate. There is no automatic rollback or redeployment of an old version; ship a newer source version with the fix.

## Run locally without publishing

Commit source changes and build first. Preparation requires a clean source checkout. Fetch the current `release` branch into `refs/remotes/origin/release` when it exists. A missing local release ref is treated as a first-release candidate; publication still checks the actual remote and refuses an unexpected existing branch.

```sh
pnpm nx run git-logs:build

RELEASE_REPOSITORY=https://github.com/tienne/orca-plugins.git \
RELEASE_VERSION=0.1.0 \
RELEASE_SOURCE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
RELEASE_REPORT=/tmp/git-logs-release-plan.json \
pnpm nx run git-logs:release-prepare
```

Choose a new report filename each time. The command validates locally and copies Git objects into a separate temporary repository; it does not contact network remotes, push, change source branches, or approve a plugin. It prints the candidate directory. Inspect it and remove it when finished. Keep the report and candidate together if publication will be performed later on the same machine.

`release-publish` is a separate target and writes remote refs. It requires `RELEASE_EXPECTED_HASH` copied from the reviewed preview, `RELEASE_PLAN` pointing to the reviewed plan, a matching HTTPS GitHub origin, and the unchanged source checkout. Use it only when publication is authorized. It is not part of CI or preview.

Run the release tests with:

```sh
pnpm nx run git-logs:release-test
ORCA_RELEASE_INTEGRATION=1 ORCA_CLI_COMMAND=orca pnpm nx run git-logs:release-test
```

Tests push only to temporary local bare repositories. The second command uses the real installed Orca validator and release hash generator. On Linux use the Orca desktop CLI name `orca-ide`, not the unrelated GNOME `orca` executable.

## Installation and directory listing

Users add the Git URL of `tienne/orca-plugins` and ref `release` under Orca **Settings → Plugins → ⋯ → Catalog sources…**. The catalog installs only `plugins/git-logs` as `tienne.git-logs`. Users do not build the source or need pnpm. Git Logs still requires execution approval on installation.

The automated release workflow publishes the custom catalog. Public-directory discovery uses a separate root export on `directory/git-logs`, tagged `vX.Y.Z`. The `git-logs/vX.Y.Z` tag continues to identify the source commit; do not move it. The repository's `orca-plugin` topic enables discovery. See the [directory status page](https://www.onorca.dev/plugins/tienne/orca-plugins) for indexing results; publishing the tag does not prove it is searchable yet.

### Publish a directory export

1. Start from the immutable artifact commit pinned by the published catalog. Export only `plugins/git-logs/` to the root of a separate Git checkout. Keep the installable files unchanged; provenance belongs in the commit message rather than extra package files.
2. Run `orca plugin validate`, `orca plugin check`, and `orca plugin release-entry` on the exported root. Compare the resulting content hash with the existing catalog release and compare every committed blob with the validated package bytes.
3. Publish `directory/git-logs` and its new `vX.Y.Z` tag atomically without rewriting existing refs. Later exports must extend the directory branch. The generic `vX.Y.Z` tags in this repository are reserved for Git Logs.
4. Check the public status page. The directory indexes on its own schedule; do not report search availability before the listing appears.

For 0.1.0, the directory tag points to `d957b8a6bbff132cac1b4e60e80d5bd518dd1a2e`, exported from artifact `c06f01b7c62909b4f8752e1e91a2f182b3dfd97e`. Both contain the same 18 files and Orca content hash `4e4723bf66e38ecee3807d05257019cd025074f6432921e6b70c41f26be14f41`. The root export passed local validation; the directory's own indexing result is tracked on its status page. Directory exports are currently a manual step and are not included in `Release Orca Plugin`.

## Orcatopia candidates

**Release Orca Plugin** now has a `plugin` selector. Its default remains `git-logs`; select `landmark-island` for Orcatopia. CI checks and uploads both plugins separately. Promotion validates the selected plugin against an allowlist, uses the artifact from the same source SHA and runs release integration tests. Both plugins share the release concurrency group and branch. Preview remains the default; the workflow supplies the hosted runner and pinned CLI, but does not configure environments or repository permissions.

Orcatopia keeps internal ID `landmark-island`, initially at `0.1.0`. Its catalog identity is `tienne.landmark-island`, source tag is `landmark-island/v0.1.0`, and package path is `plugins/landmark-island`. Candidate preparation preserves Git Logs files, catalog history and provenance. Do not use the generic `vX.Y.Z` public-directory tags reserved for Git Logs. The first release is prepared for this custom catalog. A separate public-directory listing must use a separate repository with the package at its root; no repository has been created. See the [Orcatopia release checklist](orcatopia-release.md).

After committing and building, refresh the local release base with `git fetch --no-tags origin refs/heads/release:refs/remotes/origin/release`. Then prepare locally:

```sh
pnpm nx run landmark-island:build
RELEASE_REPOSITORY=https://github.com/tienne/orca-plugins.git \
RELEASE_VERSION=0.1.0 \
RELEASE_SOURCE_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
RELEASE_REPORT=/tmp/orcatopia-release-plan.json \
pnpm nx run landmark-island:release-prepare
```

Use a new report filename on every attempt. Preparation writes a candidate in a separate temporary repository and validates it with the installed Orca CLI; it does not push or run plugin code. Review the report's source, artifact, catalog and content hash. The local source branch need not be `main` for preview; publishing later requires the exact reviewed source on remote `main`, a fresh matching release base and separate authorization. The candidate becomes stale if the source, package or release base changes.

Before publication, finish native panel clicking, full Orca restart persistence, and clean installation/update checks in an isolated profile or with an exported backup. The development identity `local.landmark-island` and catalog identity `tienne.landmark-island` need separate execution approval and save transfer through the existing backup UI. Do not assume approval or storage transfers automatically. These checks remain pending; changing the display name alone preserves the development identity.

The [English plugin guide](../plugins/landmark-island/README.md) records gameplay and limitations. The [demo images](screenshots/README.md) are browser fixtures, not host verification. Release notes for 0.1.0: worktree-earned tickets; 67 landmarks across 64 catalog countries in four tiers; 142 decorations; a 318-tile expanding island; canvas placement and bilingual inventory search; single/ten-ticket discovery with a skip checkbox; device daylight and hourly timezone weather; Korean/English UI; and local backup/restore. No cloud account, telemetry or purchases are included.

### Local preparation checks (2026-11-07)

- Both plugin builds/typechecks and worker/state suites passed through Nx; Git Logs reported 49 tests.
- Orcatopia's full 48-test UI suite and Git Logs' 22-test UI suite passed. The added English showcase/legacy-storage check passed separately (one test).
- Release orchestration/workflow tests passed 22 tests with the mock validator and another 22 with the actual Orca 1.4.250 CLI. All publication tests use disposable local bare repositories.
- `pnpm validate` passed both artifacts. Pinned actionlint 1.7.11 accepted the workflows. Independent static review of the release selector change found no issues; this is not hosted CI or production approval.
- The development host reports the Orcatopia name, running status and no reconsent requirement. Native clicks remain deferred. No remote CI run, public installation, app restart, push or publication is claimed.
